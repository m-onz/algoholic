# algoholic

algorithmic toolkit for audio and visuals for pure data &amp; GEM.

## about

algoholic is a toolkit for creating algorithmic music and visuals using the open source multimedia programming environment [pure data & GEM](https://puredata.info) at version 0.50 and higher. Algoholic is designed to run on any computer that can run Pd including single board computers like the raspberry pi. This library is similar to [else](https://github.com/porres/pd-else) but is built entirely using Pd with no compiled c externals. Else works on a raspberry pi via deken but I want a library that will only use vanilla pd abstractions for portability and ease of installation.

## installation

Please ensure you are using Pd version 0.50 and higher because some objects will not work at lower version.

* clone algoholic into your existing Pd externals folder.
* alternatively clone to a different folder and add the path in pd preferences

## author

This library was created and currently maintained by Stephen Monslow.
