        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Algoholic is a toolkit for creating algorithmic music and visuals using the open source multimedia programming environment <a href="https://puredata.info">pure data</a> (including the video extension GEM) at version 0.50 and higher.
        <br><br>Algoholic is designed to run on any computer that can run Pd including single board computers like the raspberry pi. Algoholic is built entirely using vanilla pd abstractions for increased portability and ease of installation.</p>

        <h2>Algorithmic composition with mseq</h2>
        <p>mseq is a simplified version of <a href="https://github.com/porres/pd-else" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">else/sequencer</a> that takes a message consisting of numbers: "1 2 3 4" in its right inlet.
          When mseq's left inlet is banged it will return each value in the message sequentially with rests represented as hyphens "-".
          These numbers can be used as musical notes (MIDI numbers), parameterised controls or literally anything. Although
          this is incredibly simple (compared to other algorithmic composition strategies) it has produced complex and sophisticated
          results.

        I have used this simple sequencing strategy to create music in many different genres. When people think of the term "algorithmic"
        they often mistakenly assume that algorithms must be complex. However the most simple ideas are often the most powerful.
